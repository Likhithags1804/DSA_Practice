/*nput: arr[] = [1, 2, 0, 4, 3, 0, 5, 0]
Output: arr[] = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0]
Explanation: There are three 0s that are moved to the end.

Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30]
Output: arr[] = [10, 20, 30]
Explanation: No change in array as there are no 0s.

Input: arr[] = [0, 0]
Output: arr[] = [0, 0]
Explanation: No change in array as there are all 0s. 
The idea is similar to the previous approach where we took a pointer, say count to track where the next non-zero element should be placed. However, on encountering a non-zero element, instead of directly placing the non-zero element at arr[count], we will swap the non-zero element with arr[count]. 
This will ensure that if there is any zero present at arr[count], it is pushed towards the end of array and is not overwritten.
Time Complexity: O(n), as we are traversing the array only once.
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
